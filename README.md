# Bear Hunter RPG - Terrain Generation

## Project Overview
This is a Third Person RPG where players hunt different types of bears across various forest regions. The game features a central village hub with paths leading to three distinct forest areas and a victory tower that unlocks at the end of the game.

## Current Implementation
### Terrain Generation System
We've implemented a custom terrain generator that creates:
- Central village hub (flat area)
- Three forest clearings for bear encounters
- Elevated victory tower area
- Interconnecting paths between all locations

### Required Packages
```json
{
    "com.unity.cinemachine": "2.10.3",
    "com.unity.render-pipelines.universal": "14.0.11",
    "com.unity.terrain-tools": "5.0.5"
}
```

### Layer Setup
```
Layer 6: Ground
Layer 7: Terrain
Layer 8: Environment
Layer 9: Player
Layer 10: Enemy
Layer 11: Interactable
```

## Git Commits

### Initial Setup
```git
commit: "Initial project setup with required packages"
- Added Cinemachin
- Added Universal Render Pipeline
- Added Terrain Tools
- Updated project settings
```





## Next Steps
1. Add terrain texturing
2. Implement tree placement
3. Add environment props
4. Set up lighting and atmosphere
5. Configure player character and camera

## Usage Instructions
1. Create a new terrain in Unity (3D Object > Terrain)
2. Open the Terrain Generator (Tools > Terrain Generator)
3. Assign your terrain to the generator
4. Adjust settings as needed
5. Click "Generate Terrain" to create the landscape

## Notes
- The terrain generator creates a procedural landscape with distinct areas for gameplay
- All settings are adjustable through the editor window
- The victory tower path can be toggled for testing purposes

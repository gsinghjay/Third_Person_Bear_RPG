# Bear Hunter RPG - Terrain Generation

## Project Overview
This is a Third Person RPG where players hunt different types of bears across various forest regions. The game features a central village hub with paths leading to three distinct combat arenas and a victory tower.

## Current Implementation
### Terrain Generation System
We've implemented a custom terrain generator that creates:
- Central village hub (flat area)
- Three combat arenas for bear encounters
- Elevated victory tower area
- Interconnecting paths between all locations

### Required Packages
```json
{
    "com.unity.cinemachine": "2.10.3",
    "com.unity.render-pipelines.universal": "14.0.11",
    "com.unity.terrain-tools": "5.0.5"
}
```

### Layer Setup
```
Layer 6: Ground
Layer 7: Terrain
Layer 8: Environment
Layer 9: Player
Layer 10: Enemy
Layer 11: Interactable
```

## Inspector Settings Guide

### Terrain Object Settings
```
Terrain Width: 1000

```

### Terrain Generator Window (Tools > Terrain Generator)
#### General Settings
- **Base Height**: 20 (Base terrain elevation)
- **Mountain Height**: 100 (Maximum mountain peaks)
- **Noise Scale**: 50 (Controls terrain roughness)

#### Village Settings
- **Village Radius**: 100 (Size of central flat area)
- **Transition Zone**: 50 (Smooth blend to mountains)
- **Village Height**: 30 (Elevation of village area)

#### Path Settings
- **Path Width**: 15 (Width of connecting paths)
- **Path Smoothness**: 20 (Blend between path and terrain)

#### Victory Tower Settings
- **Include Tower Path**: Toggle for testing
- **Tower Position**: (0.5, 0.1) Vector2 field
- **Tower Area Radius**: 50
- **Tower Height**: 80
- **Tower Path Width**: 20

## Combat Areas
### Northwest Arena - Fire Bears
- Radius: 35 units
- Population: 2 normal bears, 2 fire bears
- Flatness: 0.85 (slight terrain variation)
- Position: (0.25, 0.25)

### Northeast Arena - Ice Bears
- Radius: 40 units
- Population: 1 normal bear, 3 ice bears
- Flatness: 0.9 (more even terrain)
- Position: (0.75, 0.25)

### South Arena - Boss Area
- Radius: 50 units (largest arena)
- Population: 2 normal bears, 2 fire bears, 2 ice bears
- Flatness: 0.95 (very flat for boss fights)
- Position: (0.5, 0.75)

## Bear Types
- **Normal Bears**: Standard enemy type
- **Fire Bears**: Special enemy with fire-based attacks
- **Ice Bears**: Special enemy with ice-based attacks

## Spawn System
- Each arena has predetermined spawn points
- Spawn points are generated in a circular pattern
- Points are placed at 60% of arena radius
- Equal spacing between spawn points

### Important Notes
- All positions are normalized (0-1 range)
- Heights are in world units
- Radius values are in terrain units
- Changes take effect upon clicking "Generate Terrain"
- Settings can be adjusted in real-time
- Generator preserves terrain data resolution

## Usage Instructions
1. Create a new terrain in Unity (3D Object > Terrain)
2. Open the Terrain Generator (Tools > Terrain Generator)
3. Assign your terrain to the generator
4. Configure settings in each section:
   - Adjust general terrain parameters
   - Set village area size and height
   - Position forest areas
   - Configure victory tower location
5. Click "Generate Terrain" to create the landscape
6. Fine-tune settings as needed
7. Save terrain changes in Unity

## Next Steps
1. Add terrain texturing
2. Implement tree placement
3. Add environment props
4. Set up lighting and atmosphere
5. Configure player character and camera

## Troubleshooting
- If terrain appears too steep: Reduce mountain height or increase noise scale
- If paths are too narrow: Increase path width values
- If transitions are harsh: Increase transition zone or path smoothness
- If forest areas overlap: Adjust positions in normalized space
```
